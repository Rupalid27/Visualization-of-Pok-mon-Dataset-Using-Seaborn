# Visualization-of-Pok-mon-Dataset-Using-Seaborn
**Pokemon Dataset Visualization:**
The Pokemon dataset contains comprehensive information about various Pokemon species, including attributes like type, attack, defense, speed, and more

Key Visualizations Included:

Scatter Plots: Comparing Pokemon attributes to identify potential correlations and patterns among the species.
Swarm Plots: Displaying attributes based on Pokemon types, offering a visual understanding of differences between different types.
Bar Plots: Illustrating the distribution of attributes across different Pokemon types.
Heatmaps: Visualizing the correlation matrix of attributes, revealing interdependencies among characteristics.
Box Plot: The Box Plot provides a comprehensive view of the distribution and spread of Pokemon attributes, such as attack, defense, and speed. It helps identify potential outliers and understand the central tendency of each attribute.
Violin Plot: The Violin Plot is a combination of a box plot and kernel density estimation. It showcases the distribution of attributes across different Pokemon types, offering a clearer understanding of attribute variations among types.
Kernel Density Estimation Plot: The Kernel Density Estimation Plot visualizes the probability density of attributes, providing a smooth representation of attribute distributions. It helps identify the likelihood of attribute values occurring within the dataset.
Count Plot:The Count Plot displays the frequency of different Pokemon types, allowing a quick overview of the distribution of Pokemon species among types.
